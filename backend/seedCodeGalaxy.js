The most prominent feature of Python is its strict use of **Indentation** to define scope.\n\nUnlike languages that use curly braces `{}` to define code blocks (such as functions or loops), Python relies strictly on whitespace. If you misplace even a single space, the interpreter will throw an `IndentationError`. This module teaches beginners how to structure their code cleanly so that it is easily understandable by both humans and machines.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nif True:\n    print('Correct indentation!')\n```\nBy strictly adhering to indentation rules, Python naturally enforces good coding practices from day one!" },

In this module, we will explore the core types in Python:\n\n* **Integers & Floats**: Working with whole numbers and decimals for mathematical operations.\n* **Strings**: Handling textual data, such as usernames or descriptive messages. Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters.\n* **Booleans**: The basis for all logical decisions (`True` or `False`).\n\nYou will learn how Python handles dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare variable types like you do in C or Java—Python intelligently infers the type automatically." },

Operators map directly to the logic of your application.\n\nHere, we cover everything from basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`) to comparison operators (`==`, `>`, `<`). You will also learn how to build complex conditional logic using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`. Understanding how expressions are evaluated and the order of operator precedence is crucial for avoiding mathematical bugs in your logic!" },

Additionally, you will learn how to securely collect data from users using the `input()` function. Collecting and presenting data represents your first real step toward building practical real-world applications." },
